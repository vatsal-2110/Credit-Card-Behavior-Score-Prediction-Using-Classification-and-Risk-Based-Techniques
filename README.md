ðŸ’³ Credit Card Behaviour Score Prediction
Using Classification and Risk-Based Techniques

This project builds a machine learning pipeline to predict whether a customer is likely to default on their credit card payment next month, using financial and behavioral data. It emphasizes real-world challenges such as class imbalance, interpretability, and business risk alignment, deploying advanced modeling and feature engineering strategies.

ðŸŽ¯ Problem Statement
To predict whether a customer will default in the next month (next_month_default) using historical records of:

Credit limits

Demographics (age, education, marital status)

Monthly billing and payments

Payment delay history

The problem is a binary classification task with a highly imbalanced dataset, requiring both recall optimization and model explainability.
